Monitoring System to Telegram

Description
The main idea is to get static images from old IP cameras, using ffmepg in a raspberry pi, to send the captured frames to a Telegram chat group
Mostly because is a good use of old good hardware, the cameras still works, but also you can avoid the use of propietary methods from camera manufacturer.

Installation and configuration
Dependencies:
-ffmpeg. For full details go to https://ffmpeg.org/ ( soon to come a description to get it running in a RaspberryPI)
-Telegram HTTP Token and a Chat group ID ( soon to come a description on how to gei it)

Usage
The script runs as it, maybe the best option is to schedule it via cron o similar.
